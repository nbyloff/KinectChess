This is just a sample project learning OpenGL. Currently it does not work, 
Currently try to fix moving pieces around and determing how to translate a game piece to the
square that is clicked (after a game piece is selected).

No game logic has been implemented, just working on moving to the correct square.

This code is not using the model
as a resource file, so on line 9 of main.cpp, you MUST put in the full path to the obj file
